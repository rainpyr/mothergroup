# Mother Group 930 APP

Mother Group 930 is a web based app inspired by my mothergroup chat. We usually start talking about everything from 9:30 pm every night, just because it is the time kids are in bed.

Our topics varied, however, most are about where we can take kids to and also share some second-hand stuff with someone needs it.

I have developed two sections in the App, one is an "Activity Board", and the other one is "Marketplace".

## Description
![This is the view of the homePage](image/homepage-screenshot.png)

* User singip/login system: non-users can view all content, however, only signed up users can post/edit/delete content created by themselve.

* Once an acitivty is posted, users can view it, and add it to their own bookings. Bookings can be checked on the user's profile page.

* Once a marketplace product is posted, user can view it, and add it to their own buys. Payment system is not estalished yet, this is more like an information sharing section.

* All activities and products are tagged by categories, everyone can go to the category tag to see all activities/products under this category.
